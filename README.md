# NewsExplorer

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>NewsExplorer is a news aggregator that allows users to login, search, browse and save articles from 150,000 sources worldwide. Users can bookmark articles to store them on their saved articles page and remove them as needed. This project integrates Googles NewsAPI.</p>

<h3>Project Description</h3>
<p>This full stack MERN application was one of the first that i developed. During its creation i had the opportunity to further my understanding of database model & Web API creation, the use of middlewares in backend development, best practices when it came to endpoint creation and routing, the use controllers for request handling, loggers, component composition in React, user authentication, JSON Web Tokens, React state management, custom hooks, working with 3rd party API's and more. The project was implemented following a Figma design template and is responsive.</p>

<h3>Technologies & Tools</h3>
- React <br>
- MongoDB <br>
- ExpressJS <br>
- NodeJS <br>
- Googles NewsAPI <br>
- Google Cloud <br>

<h3>What Did I Learn?</h3>
<p>After each project, I always take a moment to reflect on my design decisions within the project and what I learned generally. One thing that came to my attention during the completion of this project was the nuances of user experience in web development. For example, displaying messages when a user types in invalid login data, messages when they type in correct data, messages when a server error occurs, messages when the login was successful, and how to manage these program states in React effectively. Another thing that I had to consider when working on this project was whether I should reuse a React component for multiple applications within the program. I had come to realize that if you attempt to 'abstract' a component to a point at which it can be used in multiple contexts, it can often lead to more work than simply creating a new component entirely. The use of higher-order components helped me navigate these issues when completing this project, as they provided a nice middle ground in which I could extend component functionality without excessive code duplication of lower-order components.</p>
